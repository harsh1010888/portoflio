DEPRECATED: This server-side MongoDB implementation was added earlier but the project has moved to a frontend-only Supabase solution.

If you previously added this backend and don't plan to use it, you can safely remove the entire `server/` folder. The recommended approach now is to use `src/components/ViewCounterModule.jsx` which uses Supabase directly from the frontend.

If you still want a backend-based counter, keep the files here and follow the original instructions (this file is intentionally left short because the Supabase frontend approach is preferred).
